# CompetitiveSudoku

Play Sudoku with AI!

- This project comes from the course _Foundation of AI_ at TU/e where we develop three AI agents to play this game.
- The original repo: https://github.com/nggianno/2AMU10 Thanks to my teammates.
- Here I package this game and make it more interactive so that everyone can play it online.
